<h2>Welcome to Dresden</h2>
<p>It doesn’t matter which way you came here or why. You’re now in Dresden and in Germany and we want to heartily welcome you.  For us, this means to give you first some information and for you to be open minded and to follow some advice. This may seem a bit difficult at first, but with time it will become easier. We promise this to you. We? That is the network “Dresden for all”, which was funded in November 2014 to improve the welcoming of refugees in Dresden.</p>
<p>Germany is divided in sixteen (16) so called federal states, which have certain duties and their own small government. These small states are partly independent but belong to Germany. Saxony is the federal state you are now in and Dresden is its capital city. The total number of asylum seekers are distributed between these sixteen federal states with special diameters. When you arrive in Saxony as an asylum seeker, you most likely wouldn’t have had anything to say in this matter. We do know this. Nevertheless we want to enable you to feel comfortable here.</p>
<p>Dresden is the capital of the federal state of Saxony. The city lies on the river Elbe, has about 540,000 residents and is famous for its baroque architecture in the Oldtown. Dresden has a relatively low percentage of migrants. A part of the population in Dresden is not always friendly to strangers. Another part of the population wants to change this and together with your help. The city has numerous cultural institutions, a big university and quite a growing corporate landscape. Nevertheless the rate of unemployment is relatively high. It is not easy to find a job here, especially if you’re from a faraway country. Please be prepared for this.</p>
<p>There are many associations, initiatives, institutions and groups in Dresden, which want to welcome you here. You can find so called “welcoming networks” in some city districts. These will help you with any daily problems. There are also special groups for women, men, sport facilities and a number of initiatives, which want to help you to feel comfortable and ease your everyday life. You will find these groups categorized on our map. We recommend that you look around and we will inform you about different offers. If you like any of the offers, than feel free to take them, write them an e-mail or a message on Facebook.</p>
<p>We can only imagine why you chose to leave your homeland and what happened there or on your journey. We hope you will find some peace on the riverbanks of the Elbe, in one of our parks and get in contact with people who have been living here for a while. We want to welcome you as part of our society and hope that you will find a permanent place in Germany. Therefore you absolutely need to consider some advice for the asylum procedure.</p>

<h2>The asylum procedure – a permanent place to stay?</h2>
<p>Germany offers protection for refugees. This is stated in the German constitution, the so called “Grundgesetz”. These rules were based on the experiences from the National Socialism (during the Second World War), when millions of people were killed by Germans (“Nazis”) and millions of people were forced to flee Germany to save themselves and found protection in other countries. According to Article 16a of the “Grundgesetz” people subject to political persecution have a right to seek asylum in Germany. Unfortunately it is not that easy. This constitutional right was altered so that we would now have a lot of restrictions. So even if you’re sure that you have the right to demand protection, it is possible that the courts in Germany may have a different view on such things. In Germany, asylum is granted on the basis of the “Grundgesetz”, the Geneva (Refugee) Convention (Genfer Fl&uuml;chtlingskonvention) and some other laws.</p>
<p>To confirm your claim for asylum, we strongly advise you to get all the information about the asylum procedure. There are several reasons for political persecution. You could have been pursued because; you belong to an ethnical minority, your religion/beliefs, your sexual orientation, war in your homeland or because you were politically active and fought against dictatorships/tyrannies and their helpers. At a specific date you have to explain all your reasons during a consultation/hearing to an official (civil servant) of the “Bundesamt f&uuml;r Migration und Fl&uuml;chtlinge” (BAMF; federal office for migration and refugees). These officials are no psychotherapists. They may seem to be uncaring or unfriendly but it is very important that you explain your reasons without fear and as detailed as possible. Please read beforehand this <a href="_Resources/Static/Packages/DDFA.dresdenfueralleDe/_files/interviewAdvice_en.pdf" target="_blank">leaflet</a> regarding the hearing during the asylum procedure. Be vigilant in that your interpreter explains everything to you. Do not let them put you under pressure. If you have any doubts you need to ask and clarify your questions. If you find something strange during your hearing, please note this. If you cannot write than tell this to your friends, acquaintances, meet with political activists (see point 9) or get advice from an attorney (point 4). If you want to get more information about the asylum procedure, than visit the homepage of the group “Eingeschlossen-ausgeschlossen” (German) http://www.eingeschlossen-ausgeschlossen.de/#Asylsystem/Weg.  There you will find an overview of the different courses and particularities of your asylum procedure as well as an explanation of the most important terms. If you are affected by the Dublin-proceedings, you can find important information about this on the homepage of the NAMF (German, English, French, Arabic) http://namf.blogsport.de/asylverfahren/.</p>
<p>The duration of the asylum procedure is mostly a time of stagnation. You have to wait, you cannot make plans for your future, you have no chance to get employed  and you are not allowed to choose your residence freely. We know that this time can be mentally burdening. Therefore it is very important that you start to use and organize your time and become a part of our community. We know that you do not have so many possibilities because of the German laws and sometimes it can feel like you are only a second-class being. Nevertheless we want to show you how you can become active. To achieve this you have to learn languages, especially the language which is spoken here: German.</p>

<h2>Language and communication is everything – learning German, translation, interpreting</h2>
<p>You need the German Language in Dresden. English can help you in some ways, but long-term you have to learn German. This has many reasons. If you want to get along with your daily life, you can do it best if you speak the language that most people do. Sports, bars, shopping, work – language is a major key in all these things. Most important: all public offices and authorities communicate only in German. We wish that the social welfare offices would offer forms in other languages and had officials who could speak multiple languages but unfortunately that is not always the case. To pass the asylum procedure with the best outcome it is essential to learn German. It will make things a lot easier.</p>
<p>Interpreters and translation aids are good options in the beginning, especially when you have arrived just a short time ago. Get informed about the office hours of your social workers responsible for your accommodation. They can provide you first aid (linguistically). They also know how you can find people who will help you with the translation. If you cannot find a social worker, use the migration consulting of the various initiatives or groups.</p>
<p>These could be most helpful: the Saxon refugee council (<span class="locationLink" name="556e1d4c72a6e">sächsischer Fl&uuml;chtlingsrat</span>), the council for foreigners (<span class="locationLink" name="556e1d420242a">Ausländerrat</span>), the contact group Asylum (<span class="locationLink" name="556e1d33f0698">Kontaktgruppe Asyl</span>), the Caritas and the Dresden society for social integration of foreigners and refugees/emigrants (<span class="locationLink" name="556e1d53c320a">Dresdner Verein f&uuml;r soziale Integration von Ausländern und Aussiedlern</span>). Simply follow the links. The location of these groups can be found on our map. Information about the office times can be found in the associated info boxes.</p>
<p>You can also contact the community interpreter service (<span class="locationLink" name="556e1d5057f02">Gemeindedolmetscherdienst</span>). Sometimes it can happen that they cannot help you immediately. This service is provided by volunteers. So you might have to be patient.</p>
<p>German courses are provided by numerous Initiatives. In the beginning you will often not fulfil the qualifications which are needed to get a state-approved German course. Therefore you need to use the voluntarily offered German courses. The biggest group which is organizing these courses is the DAMF (<span class="locationLink" name="556e1d313acbd">Deutschkurse Asyl, Migration, Flucht; English: German courses, asylum, migration, escape</span>). The assessment tests are multiple times a year. Please write an e-mail to the group at: dampf-dd@gmx.de. You can also find them on Facebook and of course on our map. It is important that you finish the course you started. Please take time for the course, even if it is exhausting. There are often long waiting lists and free places cannot be assigned easily during a current semester.</p>
<p>If you are living in Germany for three months and have the language level A1, you can possibly attend a so called ESF-course (European social front). This is a program which is financed by the European Union (EU) and supports “German courses for Business”. Refugees can part take in this program under special circumstances. Your social worker can provide you with more information about it. Please ask him or her!</p>

<h2>Right and wrong – here you will find help and the advice of an attorney/lawyer</h2>
<p>You can get in conflict with different authorities in Dresden. The police can be sometimes discriminating; public offices and authorities may not understand you. In addition you possibly need a lawyer for your asylum procedure. Do not forget – you have rights. At the moment we are working hard to make your rights and obligations understandable to you and hopefully provide it in your mother tongue/language. You should find them here soon.</p>
<p>If your rights should be infringed, you can push legal proceedings. You should always evaluate if you need a lawyer because they cost money. In case of doubt it is better to get a lawyer. He or she can give you advice in legal questions and also explain the asylum procedure to you. An orientation consultation-hour is held for free  once a week (Thursdays 16.00-18.00/ 4-6pm) at the council for foreigners (<span class="locationLink" name="556e1d420242a">Ausländerrat</span>). You can meet competent lawyers there. During the regular consultation hours of the council for foreigners or the contact group asylum (<span class="locationLink" name="556e1d33f0698">Kontaktgruppe Asyl</span>) you can also ask for a lawyer. They can surely help you. Please be aware, that you have to contact an lawyer as quick as possible, if you get mails from court or the notice of rejection (“Ablehnungsbescheid”) from the “Bundesamt f&uuml;r Migration und Fl&uuml;chtlinge” (BAMF; federal office for migration and refugees). Most of these mails/letters have to be answered until a certain deadline. Only during this time it is possible to file a suit or objection. If you exceed the term, it will become more complicated for your lawyer to help you.</p>

<h2>Living – Ways out of the collective housing</h2>
<p>At the moment, a lot of people are coming to Germany and seek asylum. Many cities and villages are not prepared for this case.
	Therefore many accommodations for asylum seekers are not well equipped or just too small for the amount of refugees. Many people are living in one room.
	Refugees from different countries, which may be in conflict with each other, have to share one flat. These collective housings should be only a
	temporary solution. In officialise (bureaucratic language) they are therefore called “&uuml;bergangswohnheime” (temporary residential home). Unfortunately these residential
	homes often become the permanent solution. Problems can evolve because of different factors: bad equipped/furnished houses/rooms, unfriendly administration and the location
	of the residential home or bad house/roommates. Many of the residential homes are situated on the outskirts of the cities, so you cannot leave your room for a longer duration
	and meet with other people. Sadly, it is a hard fight to change the situation within the residential homes and most of the time you cannot do anything else other than to
	arrange yourself with the current situation. We still want to show you some opportunities which may help you to improve a bad situation in your accommodation.</p>
<p>Bad equipment/furnishing: Not enough showers? Insufficient cooking facilities? Too many people in one room? No internet? There is no simple answer to all of these questions.
	The easiest is the question: how many people can live in one room? Every asylum seeker needs to have 6m² for himself/herself in one room. That is pretty small. Sometimes
	your personal space in a room falls below this limit. If this is the case you can insist on a change of the room/flat. Ask your social worker. He/she can help you with this.
	Washroom and cooking facilities have to be there in an adequate number. There are rules for this in Saxony and these rules have to be kept by the cities.
	Many initiatives know these rules and can help you if you have problems.</p>
<p>The washing machines are broken? It is dirty everywhere? The shower does not work? Please report this to the administration of your residential home. If they won’t do anything,
	become active and seek support from groups and initiatives. It is easier to go public with your problems together. You should not be afraid because of this. We will explain
	how this works in point 9. Besides, you are not automatically entitled to have internet. The decision is up to the administration, if they want to provide internet or not.
	If there is no internet in your flat/accommodation, join forces with your roommates. Ask your social worker or friends who have been living in Dresden for a longer time.</p>
<p>Discriminating administration: Please read point 9. Sadly, racism is a problem in Germany like it is in the rest of the world. Many people make an effort to prevent this,
	but in Dresden it could happen to you, that you will be discriminated because of your skin colour or your state as asylum seeker. If you are discriminated, please consider also point 8.</p>
<p>Conflicts between house/roommates: Conflicts and violence can happen in every society, including the community of asylum seekers. Especially within the residential homes you can find
	people from all over the world. Often hierarchies will be formed inside the residential homes. Conflicts arise between people from belligerent states. If that is the case, do not stay
	quiet and pray for a solution. Seek help from your social worker or go to a counsellor/counselling centre or a meeting of the support network.</p>
<p>A change of accommodation can be authorized by the social offices for various reasons. First, you have to make your request and fill the forms. The authorization is a case to case decision.
	If you live with your family in Dresden or need rest, because of an illness, the chances are better. Sadly, there is no rule we could tell you for success.</p>

<h2>Health problems – medical information and alternative options</h2>
<p>As an asylum seeker you cannot simply go to any doctor you want like the Germans do. The medical care is regulated by the “Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz” (Asylum Seekers Benefits Act).
	This also regulates how much money an asylum seeker or ‘tolerated’ refugee gets. The act says that you “will be treated only if you have an acute illness or pain”.
	In Saxony we have not yet got a health insurance card for asylum seekers. This card would enable asylum seekers to go to a doctor on their own.
	At present you have to make a request for a so called “Krankenschein” (health insurance certificate) before you can go to a doctor. The “Krankenschein” is available at the social welfare office (Sozialamt).
	If you have problems with that, contact your social worker or counselling centre. If the social welfare office is closed and in urgent cases you can go to the emergency rooms (A+E Unit) of the hospitals/medical centres. All hospitals can be found on our city map.</p>
<p>Oftentimes it can be difficult to communicate with the doctors. Fortunately we have numerous doctors in Dresden who can speak multiple languages. To find these, you can use a smartphone app () . This app also provides you with a directory for various contact points. Click here for the download link. By the way: psychical illnesses have to be treated. Especially if you have problems caused by violence, you need to seek help from a therapist/psychologist. The “Traumaambulanz” (trauma ambulance) offers therapy options for people with terrible experiences like war, rape/violation or torture. If you cannot speak sufficient enough German, you have the opportunity to get an interpreter for the therapy. Unfortunately the waiting list for these special treatments is long.
	Another possibility is a request to Medea (<span class="locationLink" name="556e1d4585894">Medea</span>). This association organizes mother-child-groups and offers consultations for women. Men can get help from the “Männernetzwerk” (network for men).</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: If you have to hide your whereabouts from the police/ governmental authorities or you do not have a passport, it is more difficult to get medical treatment from a doctor.
	In this case the Medinetz (<span class="locationLink" name="556e1d4bf254c">Medinetz</span>) may be able to help. This is a group of medical students and doctors, who want to help you to get medical treatment and medicine even without a passport. Please do not hesitate to contact them if the need arises.</p>

<h2>Work and free time – Get in contact</h2>
<p>Various “Willkommensinitiativen” (welcoming initiatives) are organizing leisure activities, which are special tenders for asylum seekers.
	If you are new in Dresden, these offers will be perfect. Often, you will get to know new people, some of them will have been living longer in Dresden and others are as new to Dresden as you are.
	The most important thing is to spent time together. Many problems can be solved during conversations with others. Currently there are welcoming initiatives in six city districts:
	<span class="locationLink" name="556e1d35b069f">Welcome to L&ouml;btau</span>, <span class="locationLink" name="556e1d42cea11">Prohlis is colourful</span>,
	<span class="locationLink" name="556e1d47add2f">Gorbitz international</span>, <span class="locationLink" name="556e1d3d87f99">Welcome to the highland (Pappritz)</span>,
	<span class="locationLink" name="556e1d354601f">Laubegast is colourful</span>, <span class="locationLink" name="556e1d4118730">Pieschen for all</span> or <span class="locationLink" name="556e1d43b6579">Leuben is colourful</span>. Furthermore there are
	various institutions which are open for you. For example the international community centre (Internationales Begegnungszentrum) or the <span class="locationLink" name="556e1d3a0df7c">SPIKE youth club</span> (for younger people).</p>
<p>We also want to offer you a swap meet/exchange market on our homepage, where people can post leisure activities and other things .</p>
<p>The search for jobs is another important problem. Only governmental agencies offer you access to the job market. It depends on your education, abilities and what you have done before,
	whether you get a job or not. Good language skills in German and English as well as social contacts will help you too. Independent from these, you are always welcome to <span class="locationLink" name="556e1d4e90550">Kama Dresden</span>.
	KAMA stands for courses from asylum seekers, migrants and recognized asylum seekers (Kurse von Asylsuchenden, MigrantInnen und Asylberechtigten) and searches for refugees who want to offer their knowledge in a course for residents of Dresden.
	This can be cooking courses, language courses, workshops or programming courses. This gives you the opportunity, to offer your abilities or your profession to other people, if only voluntary. You can also meet and get in contact with new people.</p>

<h2>Racism – fast help for victims</h2>
<p>Racism is a problem worldwide. There is a distinct racism in Germany, which is expressed clearly from time to time. With the PEGIDA-Movement starting in October 2014, the number of racist incidences in Dresden
	is increasing. This movement encourages the rejection of almost all refugees. We want to be honest with you. This could be a problem for you. Racism can be found in small things like scowls, stupid comments
	or threats. It can go on with unfair treatment by the public offices, higher frequency of police controls and sometimes sadly ends in violence. Numerous initiatives and organizations fight against racism.
	We too, as network “Dresden for all” (Dresden f&uuml;r alle) want to campaign against racism. If you are a victim of racism contact the counselling for victims of the <span class="locationLink" name="556e1d3ca3475">RAA Sachsen</span>(Saxony).
	Experienced people are working there who can offer you psychological counselling or legal assistance. There you will meet people you can trust.</p>

<h2>Fight for your rights – become political active</h2>
<p>Maybe you have been politically active in your home country. This may have caused you suffering. You may have been in prison or were persecuted. Demonstrations may have been violently
	dissipated and the secret service may have been hunting you. Perhaps you didn’t experience any of these. Here in Germany you are not forced to hush. We want you to be quite the opposite.
	Become politically active. Various initiatives will help you with their experiences and support.</p>
<p>The “Kulturb&uuml;ro” (cultural office) regularly offers workshops for self-empowerment. There you can learn how you can become politically active and which methods can free you from a seemingly
	hopeless situation. The <span class="locationLink" name="556e1d4a3d749">Netzwerk Asyl, Migration und Flucht</span>” (Network asylum, migration and escape) fights for the improvement of the situation of the refugees in Germany with different public actions. You can always look there for help.</p>
<p>The initiatives which were founded by refugees themselves are very important. Germany-wide it is the Voice and Refugees4Refugees. You can find these kinds of organizations in Dresden also.
	The Asylum Seekers Movement tries to connect you with other refugees to fight together for an improved situation for refugees in Germany. The initiative Remembering Khaled is doing the same.</p>
<p>By the way: You are allowed to demonstrate in Dresden. The Saxon constitution warrants all people the right to demonstrate, not only people from Germany. Do not believe others if they tell
	you something different. Your political commitment in Germany must not and should not have an influence on your current asylum procedure.</p>



<h2>Last advice</h2>
<p>We hope we could provide you a first orientation in your new city of Dresden. We want to encourage you to explore your new surroundings. The best way to do this is to use the tram or the bus.
	As asylum seekers you are allowed to use the reduced tickets. Beforehand you need the so called “Dresden-Pass” which must be issued by the social welfare office. Please bring a passport photo with you.
	After you got the Dresden-Pass you can go to the public transport DVB AG at the Postplatz and buy tickets for the reduced price, not before. A good option is the monthly ticket type A1. You can use it in the whole city.</p>
<p>At last, we want to point out the fact that there are other places in Dresden where you can get essential things like food or clothing. Asylum seekers are, besides social welfare recipients
	and homeless, at risk of poverty. From time to time even the essential things could be missing. Like any other unemployed people in Dresden you are allowed to use special offers.
	The “<span class="locationLink" name="5570b8fcd6b1c">Umsonstladen</span>” (Store for free) in the Neustadt (Newtown) offers you different things like clothing for free or for a small donation.
	At the <span class="locationLink" name="5570b8db255b3">Caritas Kleiderkammer</span> (Caritas clothing store) you can buy cheap clothing.
	If you have children and need children’s clothing you can go to the <span class="locationLink" name="5570b8afd85a5">Kinderkleider-Tauschb&ouml;rse Dresden Gorbitz</span> (Children’s clothing exchange market) and also to the Kaleb Kleiderkammer (Kaleb clothing store).
	If this does not help you then post a request on our homepage. You may find one or more people in Dresden which are willing to help.</p>

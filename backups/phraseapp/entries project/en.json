We see ourselves as a supplement to the professional helpers in social work with refugees. We want to make clear at this point that the professional refugee social work is absolutely necessary, and in fact must be further improved and expanded! Our support is an addition and can by no means replace the professionals. We organize encounter afternoons, with the help of volunteer teachers we offer German language courses. We organize board game afternoons at the asylum, hikes and sports activities in the gym of the Weißeritzgymnasium. We see our tasks in the following areas: Public relations, offering sportive and cultural activities, encounter afternoons, German language courses and sponsorships. For this purpose we created appropriate working groups.",

Frauenrat, an emancipating foundation of women from the Kurdish community,  organize mainly these events.\n\nWe're looking for help on the 3rd of March in organizing applications of conceptual events, which are directed towards school girls for the most part. School classes (starting from the 7th class) can register for the 3 presentations, which happen at 10 am, 1 pm and 4 pm. The interesting part about those presentations is that the protagonists of the film \"The Beekeeper\" Ibrahim Gezer (Who is a documented beekeeper who talks about his refuge and migration story) and the director Manou Khalil will talk directly to the school girls.\n\nFor more information about the film \"The Beekeeper:\nhttp://film-kultur.de/glob/der-imker_kc.pdf",

			<!-- <h3 class="no-top-margin">How to use this website:</h3>
			<p>
				We are a web platform for refugees seeking information and for people and initiatives looking to support refugees.
			</p>
			<p>
				The symbols on the right-hand side of the screen list the type of initiatives and programs available along with their locations on the map. They are organized by theme to help you find the program(s) you are looking for more quickly. Use the flag on the top right of the screen to choose between ten different languages. In the menu on the left-hand side you will find guidlines for both refugees and for people who wish to get involved.
			</p>

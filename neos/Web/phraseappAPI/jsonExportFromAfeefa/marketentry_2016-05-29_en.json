Goal is to demonstrate, in an atmosphere in the Dresden city life and club life, regardless of skin color, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious belief, origin, purse or concept of life.\r\nAlready from 10:00 we invite to a joint breakfast. Meanwhile, the cars are built and decorated. The opening rally of the TOLERADE will take place at 14: 00 on the grounds of the Club Puschkin on Leipziger Straße. From 14:30 we travel along to the city. After a stop on the Theaterplatz we move back in the Neustadt and continue to the Industriegelände. Later this evening the TOLERADE-Party will take place at SEKTOR EVOLUTION or at the Club TBA at Schlesischer Platz where we can dance all night long. As usual all our earnings will go to local refugee initiatives.\r\nCome together."

            "description": "This is an open forum to promote kindness and understanding towards asylum seekers. \"Haselbachtal\" is a municipality near the cities Dresden and Bautzen in Germany with around 4000 inhabitants. By March 1, 35 refugees are going to move there. The \"Haselbachtalerians\" do have a lot of concerns and worries about the newcomers - and a lot of people started to support a Facebook group called \"Haselbachtal wehrt sich\" (Engl. \"Haselbachtal defends itself\") claiming that they are confronted with a flood of refugees and ignorant despotism. (Btw: Only few foreigners live in this region compared to others in Germany.) The members of our group, however, do not believe that we are in a state of some kind of war and want to support the idea of a welcoming society showing solidarity - with their hearts and minds. This is what the group name stands for: With our hearts (German: Herzen) and minds (German: Verstand) we want to engage in a fair debate providing information on migration and the asylum system as well as by sharing experiences in order to reduce prejudice and fear. Everybody is welcome here! In this group, and in the society that we want to create. We start NOW - in my hometown."

Also for asylum seekers there is only limited medical care granted. With our work we want to enable those concerned the access to health care."
